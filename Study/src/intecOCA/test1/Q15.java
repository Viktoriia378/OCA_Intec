    /*
    Your goal is to implement a method addUsage (and other methods, if required) in Bandwidth class such that
    all the bandwidth used by a User is reflected by the totalUsage field and totalBill is always equal to totalUsage*costPerByte.
     Further, that a User should not be able to tamper with the totalBill value and is also not able to reduce it.
     Which of the following implementation(s) accomplishes the above?
     The correct answer is:
public void addUsage(int bytesUsed){
    if(bytesUsed>0){
       totalUsage = totalUsage + bytesUsed;
       totalBill = totalBill + bytesUsed*costPerByte;
    }
}
     */
