The finalize() method in Object does not take any parameters.
Since the method defined in Q39 does have a parameter,
it does not override Objectâ€™s and is not called during garbage collection.
If the parameter was not in Q39's finalize() method, the answer would be option B.

/*
protected void finalize() throws Throwable
It must be named finalize
It must take zero parameters
It must have the correct signature
