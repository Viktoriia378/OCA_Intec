    All objects in Java are accessed via a reference.
    The type of the object determines which properties exist within the object in memory.
    The type of the reference to the object determines which methods and variables are accessible to the Java program.
    By casting an object to a superclass reference, you lose access to methods defined in the subclass.
    casting an object does not modify the object in memory.
