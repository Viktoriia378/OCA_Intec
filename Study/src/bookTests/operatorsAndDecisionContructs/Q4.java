    /*
    Object t = new Integer(107);
    int k = (Integer) t.intValue()/9; does not compile
    Compiler will complain that the method intValue() is not available in Object.
    This is because the . operator has more precedence than the cast operator.
    So you have to write it like this:
    int k = ((Integer) t).intValue()/9;
    System.out.println(k);
    Now, since both the operands of / are ints, it is an integer division.
    This means the resulting value is truncated (and not rounded). Therefore, the above statement will print 11 and not 12.
