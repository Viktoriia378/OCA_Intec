    Interfaces, classes, and enums are all "types". Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. In this way, Java supports multiple inheritance of types.
"State", on the other hand, is represented by instance fields. Only a class can have instance fields and therefore, only a class can have a state. (Fields defined in an interface are always implicitly static, even if you don't specify the keyword static explicitly. Therefore, an interface does not have any state.) Since a class is allowed to extend only from one class at the most, it can inherit only one state. Thus, Java does not support multiple inheritance of state.

This is an important concept and is explained in more detail here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/multipleinheritance.html

    /*
    Multiple inheritance of state includes ability to inherit instance fields from multiple classes.
    Multiple inheritance of type includes ability to implement multiple interfaces and/or ability to extend from multiple classes.
