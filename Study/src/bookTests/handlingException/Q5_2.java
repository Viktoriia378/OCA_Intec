    /*
    Java Exceptions is a mechanism ..
    that you can use to determine what to do when something unexpected happens.
Exceptions provide the means to separate the details of what to do when something out of the ordinary happens from
the main logic of a program.
Once you get an exception, you can catch it and in the catch block you can determine what actions should be taken based on the situation.
 Thus, the actions that you have to take under exceptional circumstances are isolated from the main flow of the program
 and improves clarity of the code.

If you have to select only one option then this should be the right answer. Otherwise, all other options
(which basically describe specific uses cases) are also correct.
